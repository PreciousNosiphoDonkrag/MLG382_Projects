How the py file works:

When the user runs the code:
1. The csv file is read and stored as a dataframe.
2. The dataframe is then used by a function 'add_missing()' to add values to the dataframe,
   where there are missing values, 'Loan_Amount_Term'.
3. Graphs are displayed indicating the Loan Status Imbalance, BoxPlot for Applicant Income and
   BoxPlot for Applicant Income, where the feature is against the target.
4. After the missing values are added the updated dataframe is now 'df_add_missing'.
5. The new dataframe is then used by a function 'prep_data()', to remove outliers in
   the 'ApplicantIncome' column.
6. The updated dataframe is called 'df_preped_data'.
7. A function 'displayGraph()', uses the updated dataframe to display univariate graphs of the 'Loan_Amount_Term'.
8. The updated dataframe is then stored in a csv file called 'preped_data.csv'
9. The current dataframe is displayed, 'df_preped_data'
